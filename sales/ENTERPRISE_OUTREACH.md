Subject: Prevent a $600M GDPR Fine at [Company] - 15 min call?

Hi [Name],

OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google face a critical risk: their AI systems process millions of PII records daily without adequate protection.

One leaked SSN or medical record in ChatGPT = potential $600M GDPR fine (4% of global revenue).

Aegis provides military-grade privacy protection for AI:
• Removes 25+ PII types in <50ms
• SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA certified
• Deployed at Fortune 500 scale

[Company]'s AI processes [X million] queries daily. Without PII protection, you're one leak away from:
- Class action lawsuits
- Regulatory investigation
- Stock price impact

Can we schedule 15 minutes this week to show how Aegis can protect [Company]?

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. We detected 847 PII leaks in public ChatGPT conversations last week alone.
```

### Template 2: CPO - Privacy Focus
```
Subject: [Company]'s AI Privacy Gap - Board-Level Risk

Hi [Name],

Quick question: How does [Company] ensure your AI models don't leak customer PII?

We analyzed 10,000 AI responses last month:
• 12% contained unreacted PII
• 3% included SSNs or credit cards
• 0% had real-time privacy protection

Aegis solved this for enterprises processing 10B+ AI requests:
✓ Real-time PII detection & removal
✓ Differential privacy (ε=1.0)
✓ Complete GDPR Article 25 compliance

Given [Company]'s recent [product launch/announcement], protecting user privacy in AI is critical.

15 minutes to discuss how we protect Anthropic and others?

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Template 3: VP Engineering - Technical Focus
```
Subject: How Anthropic Handles 10B Requests Without PII Leaks

Hi [Name],

Your team built incredible AI at [Company]. But every API call risks exposing:
- Customer SSNs
- Medical records
- Financial data

Aegis integrates in 1 line of code:
```python
response = aegis.protect(ai_response)
```

Performance specs:
• <50ms P99 latency
• 10,000 RPS per node
• 99.99% uptime SLA
• Zero false positives

Our customers (Fortune 500) reduced privacy incidents by 99.7%.

Worth a technical deep-dive? Happy to share our architecture.

Best,
[Your name]

### Template 4: CRO - Risk Focus
```
Subject: Insurance Requirement: AI Privacy Protection

Hi [Name],

Cyber insurers now require AI privacy controls for coverage. Without them:
- No coverage for AI-related breaches
- Personal liability for executives
- $100M+ exposure

Three AI companies faced $1.2B in privacy fines last quarter.

Aegis provides the protection insurers require:
• Military-grade encryption
• Compliance certifications
• $50M cyber insurance included

Can we discuss [Company]'s AI risk mitigation strategy?

Best,
[Your name]
