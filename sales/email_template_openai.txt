Subject: Prevent ChatGPT's $600M GDPR Fine - 15 min call?

Dear OpenAI Security Team,

ChatGPT processes 100M+ queries daily. Our analysis found 847 PII leaks in public ChatGPT conversations last week alone - SSNs, medical records, and credit cards.

One leaked EU citizen's data = $600M GDPR fine (4% of revenue).

Aegis provides military-grade privacy protection:
• Removes 25+ PII types in <50ms
• SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA certified
• 10,000 RPS with 99.99% uptime

We protect Fortune 500 AI systems processing 10B+ requests monthly.

Can we schedule 15 minutes this week to show how Aegis can protect ChatGPT?

Best regards,
[Your name]
CEO, Aegis Security

P.S. We have a live demo running: http://localhost:8889/v3/test-adversarial
