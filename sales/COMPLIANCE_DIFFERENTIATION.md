# Why Aegis Is NOT Like Drata/Vanta/SecureFrame
## The Critical Difference Between Compliance Theater and Real Protection

---

## 🎭 THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE

### Compliance Platforms (Drata/Vanta/SecureFrame):
**What they do**: Generate PDFs saying you're compliant
**What they DON'T do**: Actually protect your data

### Aegis:
**What we do**: Actually stop PII leaks in real-time
**What we DON'T do**: Waste time on paperwork

## 📊 HEAD-TO-HEAD COMPARISON

| Feature | Drata/Vanta | Aegis | Why It Matters |
|---------|-------------|-------|----------------|
| **Primary Function** | Compliance reports | Active protection | Reports don't stop breaches |
| **SOC 2 Approach** | Checkbox automation | Real security | Auditors check if protection works |
| **Data Protection** | Documents policies | Blocks PII leaks | Policies don't prevent fines |
| **Implementation** | 3-6 months | 15 minutes | Breaches happen TODAY |
| **During an Incident** | Useless | Stops it | One prevents fines |
| **Price** | $20-50K/year | $75K+/year | Protection costs more than PDFs |
| **After a Breach** | "But we were compliant!" | No breach occurred | Which do you prefer? |

## 🎯 WHEN THEY ASK: "How is this different from Drata?"

### Your Power Response:

> "Great question! Drata is like having a smoke detector certificate on your wall. Aegis is the actual sprinkler system that stops the fire.
>
> Drata proves you have policies about PII protection. Aegis actually protects PII.
>
> When ChatGPT leaks an SSN, what stops the $600M fine - Drata's PDF or Aegis blocking the leak?
>
> You need both: Drata for the paperwork, Aegis for the protection."

## 💡 SPECIFIC SCENARIOS TO ILLUSTRATE

### Scenario 1: The Audit
**With Drata alone:**
- Auditor: "Show me PII protection"
- You: "Here's our policy document"
- Auditor: "But I found 100 SSNs in your AI logs"
- You: "..."
- **Result**: Failed audit, fines

**With Aegis:**
- Auditor: "Show me PII protection"
- You: "Here's Aegis blocking PII in real-time"
- Auditor: "I can't find any PII leaks"
- You: "Exactly"
- **Result**: Passed audit, no fines

### Scenario 2: The Breach
**With Drata alone:**
- 9 AM: AI leaks customer SSNs
- 10 AM: Customer tweets about it
- 11 AM: Lawyers calling
- 12 PM: Stock drops 20%
- Drata: "Your policies were documented!"

**With Aegis:**
- 9 AM: AI tries to leak SSN
- 9:00:01 AM: Aegis blocks it
- Nothing happens
- Business continues

### Scenario 3: The Sales Call
**Customer with Drata:**
- "Are you SOC 2 compliant?"
- "Yes, Drata certified us"
- "But can you prove no PII in your AI?"

**Customer with Aegis:**
- "Are you SOC 2 compliant?"
- "Yes, and Aegis protects all PII"
- "Prove it"
- *Shows real-time demo*

## 📝 COMPLIANCE PLATFORM COEXISTENCE

### The Truth: **You Need Both**

**Drata/Vanta** = Compliance Documentation
**Aegis** = Compliance Implementation

It's like:
- **Drata** = Driver's license (proves you can drive)
- **Aegis** = Airbags (saves your life)

## 💬 COMMON OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES

### "We already have Drata for compliance"
> "Perfect! Drata documents your compliance. Aegis implements it. When the auditor asks 'How do you prevent PII leaks?' - Drata shows the policy, Aegis shows it working."

### "Drata says we're SOC 2 compliant"
> "SOC 2 requires 'appropriate technical controls.' Drata documents them. Aegis IS them. Without Aegis, you're compliant on paper but exposed in reality."

### "Isn't compliance enough?"
> "Ask Meta about their $1.3B fine. They were 'compliant' too. Compliance means you have policies. Protection means policies work."

### "Drata is cheaper"
> "Drata costs $30K. A breach costs $30M. Which expense would you rather explain to the board?"

### "We don't need both"
> "You're right - if you never plan to process PII. But every AI system does. Drata without protection is like insurance without brakes."

### Always Say:
- "Drata for paperwork, Aegis for protection"
- "Compliance platforms document. We implement."
- "They work together perfectly"
- "Drata proves compliance. Aegis achieves it."

## 💰 PRICING PSYCHOLOGY

When they say Drata is cheaper:

> GDPR Fine: $600M = What happens with Drata alone
>
> Would you rather save $45K or $600M?"

## 🚀 THE CLOSE

**"Look, Drata is great at what they do - compliance documentation. We're great at what we do - actual protection.**

**You wouldn't buy car insurance then remove your brakes. Don't get SOC 2 certified then leave your AI unprotected.**

**Drata gets you certified. Aegis keeps you safe.**

**Which problem is more urgent - paperwork or protection?"**

**Remember: We're not competing with Drata. We're completing the stack. They do compliance theater. We do compliance reality.**
