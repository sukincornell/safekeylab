## 🎯 COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

### Against Open Source (Presidio):
> "Would you trust your $600M GDPR risk to free software that's 70% accurate?"

### Against Cloud Giants (Google/AWS):
> "They built DLP for databases in 2010. You need AI protection for 2024."

### Against Startups (Private AI, Nightfall):
> "They do detection. We do complete protection. One product vs five."

### Against Enterprise (BigID, OneTrust):
> "They generate compliance reports. We prevent breaches. Which do you need?"

## 📊 COMPETITIVE BATTLE CARDS

### When They Say: "We use Microsoft Presidio"
**You Say**:
"Presidio missed 30% of PII in our tests. That's 300 SSNs per million requests. One miss = $600M fine. Plus you need 3 engineers for 6 weeks to implement it. We're 99.9% accurate and deploy in 15 minutes."

### When They Say: "Google DLP is enterprise standard"
**You Say**:
"Google DLP costs $50 per GB. At your scale that's $2M/year. It was built for structured databases, not AI conversations. We're 10x cheaper and built specifically for AI."

### When They Say: "We built it in-house"
**You Say**:
"JPMorgan spent $50M building their own and still got fined. You want your engineers building products or compliance tools? We're SOC 2 certified already."

### When They Say: "Private AI is AI-focused too"
**You Say**:
"Private AI only detects PII. What about prompt injection? Model inversion? Differential privacy? We prevent all AI privacy attacks, not just PII."
