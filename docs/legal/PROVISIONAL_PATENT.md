### Description of Related Art

[0008] Current privacy protection systems suffer from fundamental limitations when applied to AI systems.

[0009] Microsoft Presidio (U.S. Pat. No. 10,885,227) provides static rule-based detection without context awareness.

[0010] Google Cloud DLP (U.S. Pat. No. 11,093,640) lacks adaptive parameter optimization.

[0011] AWS Macie (U.S. Pat. No. 10,997,322) is limited to cloud-specific implementations.

[0012] None of these systems provide mathematical privacy guarantees, AI agent safety monitoring, or privacy budget management required for modern AI deployments.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

### Note for Provisional Application

[0032] As this is a provisional patent application, the claims and formal patent prosecution requirements are relaxed. This description provides sufficient detail to establish the invention and secure a priority date.

### System Architecture Overview

[0033] Referring to FIG. 1, the system 100 comprises interconnected components working synergistically.

[0034] The Privacy Budget Manager 102 maintains cumulative privacy budget across operations.

[0035] The AI Agent Safety Monitor 104 ensures output compliance with safety requirements.

[0036] The PII Detection Engine 106 uses hierarchical multi-head attention.

[0037] The Contextual Differential Privacy Engine 108 adapts parameters based on context.

[0038] The Hardware Acceleration Layer 110 leverages TEEs for secure processing.

*Sukin Yang – Provisional Patent Application – Page 6*

### Privacy Budget Manager Implementation

[0039] The Privacy Budget Manager implements cumulative privacy accounting as follows:

[0040] First, the system initializes with a total privacy budget epsilon_total, typically set to 1.0.

[0041] For each operation, the system checks if sufficient budget remains.

[0042] If budget is available, the operation proceeds and budget is consumed.

[0043] The system maintains an immutable audit trail of all operations.

[0044] Budget regenerates over time at a configurable rate.

### AI Agent Safety Monitor Implementation

[0045] The AI Agent Safety Monitor evaluates outputs against multiple criteria.

[0046] NIST AI Risk Management Framework compliance is verified through governance checks.

[0047] EU AI Act requirements are validated for high-risk AI systems.

[0048] Harm potential is assessed using pattern matching and semantic analysis.

[0049] Outputs failing safety checks are blocked or filtered.

*Sukin Yang – Provisional Patent Application – Page 7*

### PII Detection Architecture

[0050] The PII detection employs three hierarchical processing levels.

[0051] Token-level processing uses 12 attention heads for local context.

[0052] Entity-level processing uses 8 attention heads for relationships.

[0053] Document-level processing uses 4 attention heads for global context.

[0054] Ensemble voting across levels achieves 99.9% accuracy.

### Contextual Differential Privacy Engine

[0055] The CDP engine adapts privacy parameters based on context.

[0056] Context includes regulatory requirements, data sensitivity, and utility needs.

[0057] Binary search with gradient acceleration finds optimal parameters.

[0058] Convergence occurs in O(log n) iterations.

[0059] Mathematical privacy guarantees are maintained throughout.

### Hardware Acceleration

[0060] The system supports multiple Trusted Execution Environments.

[0061] Intel SGX provides encrypted memory and attestation.

[0062] AMD SEV enables encrypted virtualization.

[0063] ARM TrustZone offers secure world execution.

[0064] Cloud providers offer native enclave support.
